# diarize-ruby

This library provides an easy-to-use toolkit for speaker segmentation (diarization) and identification from audio.

This library was adopted from [diarize-jruby](https://github.com/bbc/diarize-jruby), being used within the BBC R&D World Service.

The main reason from deviating from the original library is to have a universal gem that works with either Ruby interpreter. It uses [Ruby Java Bridge](http://rjb.rubyforge.org) instead of [JRuby](http://jruby.org).

Work to be done:

* Universal gem that works on JRuby and various Ruby implementations (MRI) and versions
* Use performant math packages tuned to either Ruby implementation
* Add support for alternative diarization tools
* Add CI tool

## Speaker Diarization

This library gives acccess to the algorithm developed by the LIUM
for the ESTER 2 evaluation campaign and described in [Meigner2010].

It wraps a binary JAR file compiled from [LIUM](http://lium3.univ-lemans.fr/diarization/doku.php/welcome).

## Speaker Identification

This library also implements an algorithm for speaker identification
based on the comparison of normalised speaker models, which can be
accessed through the Speaker#match method.

This algorithm builds on top of the LIUM toolkit and uses the following
techniques:

 * "M-Norm" normalisation of speaker models [Ben2003]
 * The symmetric Kullback-Leibler divergence approximation described in [Do2003]
 * The detection score specified in [Ben2005]

It also includes support for speaker supervectors [Campbell2006], which
can be used in combination with our ruby-lsh library for fast speaker
identification.

## Install

    $ bundle install

If you are using a different version of LIUM than what is bundled in the `bin` folder, you can do so by setting an environment variable.

    $ export DIARIZE_RUBY_RJB_LOAD_PATH=<path-to-LIUM-jar-file>

## Examples

    $ irb -I lib
    > require "diarize"
    > audio = Diarize::Audio.new URI.join('file:///', File.join(File.expand_path(File.dirname(__FILE__)), "test", "data", "will-and-juergen.wav"))
    > audio.analyze!
    > audio.segments
    > audio.speakers
    > audio.to_rdf
    > speakers = audio.speakers
    > speakers.first.gender
    > speakers.first.model.mean_log_likelihood
    > speakers.first.model.components.size
    > ...
    > speakers ||= other_speakers
    > Diarize::Speaker.match(speakers)


## Running tests

    $ rake
